\begin{abstract}

Understanding the dynamics of plant pathogen populations is imperative to
understanding what management strategies are important. With the advent of more
advanced and cheaper sequencing technologies, obtaining genomic sequences for
representative populations has been easier than ever before. This in combination
with a move towards more reproducible research has lead researchers to move away
from traditional stand alone programs for population genetic analysis to modular
programs such as R, which has a vibrant community of contributers submitting
packages tailored for several analyses, including population genetics. The R
package poppr was released to specifically address issues surrounding analysis
of clonal populations and has recently implemented several tools that better
facilitate the analysis of clonal populations across different levels of
hierarchies, implementing multilocus genotype definitions and the index of
association for reduced representation genomic data, and modular bootstrapping
of any genetic distance.

# Introduction {-}

Multiple references get a semi-colon [@wilson2014best; @wilson2014best]. References that
are simply mentioned, such as @wilson2014best, are cited without square braces.

- Rise in popularity of reproducible methods
    - shitty standalone programs 
- Packages available in R
    - Previous lack of tools for clonal populations, still lack of tools for genomic data sets
        - How do you deal with clones?
        - How do you detect linkage? 
        - How do you know if you've sampled enough?

# Materials and Methods {-}

## Clone correction {-}

As highlighted in previous work, clone correction is an important part of population genetic analysis of organisms that have cryptic growth or are known to produce asexual propagules [@kamvar2014poppr; @milgroom1996recombination; @grunwald2003analysis]. 
 
 - Clone correction based on genetic distance
    - reduced representation data (GBS)
    - consistent clones with one or two highly variable loci (Cooke example)
    - nearest neighbor; farthest neighbor; average neighbor
 - Index of Association
    - Invented for small number of markers
    - Methods of $\bar{r}_d$ for large number of markers:
      - sliding window (could be a fast way to detect linkage)
      - random sampling of x loci (creates a distribution of $\bar{r}_d$)
 - Bootstrapping genetic distance
    - Matrix algebra makes it easy to calculate genetic distance in R (with alleles in columns).
    - Alleles in columns makes it hard to bootstrap (alleles are not independent units).
 - Population Stratification
    - Necessary for analyses of factorial sampling [@everhart2014fine] or hierarchical sampling [@linde2002population]
    - Implementation in StrataG and Hierfstat loosely defined.
    - Solution in S4 classes: strict definition.
    - adopted by larger community
    

## Additions {-}

- Psex
- Bootstrapping for individuals or populations for any genetic distance
- MLG clustering
- Index of Association for genomic sequences
- Parallelization
- Genotype Accumulation Curve
- Matching Ties in Minimum Spanning networks (Cite ramorum paper)

# Results {-}

## Speed {-}

## Community Acceptance {-}

- articles that have cited poppr
- hierarchical methods have been ported to adegenet

# Discussion {-}

- loops in graphs allow for analysis of population structure via graph walking algorithms in igraph
- bootstrapping methods encourage future developers to write distance implementations in common format
- moving towards open source, modular tools is the direction that population genetics and plant pathology needs to go.
