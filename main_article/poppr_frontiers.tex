\begin{abstract}

Understanding the dynamics of plant pathogen populations is imperative to
understanding what management strategies are important. With the advent of more
advanced and cheaper sequencing technologies, obtaining genomic sequences for
representative populations has been easier than ever before. This in combination
with a move towards more reproducible research has lead researchers to move away
from traditional stand alone programs for population genetic analysis to modular
programs such as R, which has a vibrant community of contributers submitting
packages tailored for several analyses, including population genetics. The R
package poppr was released to specifically address issues surrounding analysis
of clonal populations and has recently implemented several tools that better
facilitate the analysis of clonal populations across different levels of
hierarchies, implementing multilocus genotype definitions and the index of
association for reduced representation genomic data, and modular bootstrapping
of any genetic distance.

  population genetics and plant pathology needs to go.
