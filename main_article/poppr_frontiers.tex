\begin{abstract}

Understanding the dynamics of plant pathogen populations is imperative to
understanding plant microbe interactions, adaptation of pathogens to hosts,
reactive breeding and deployment of R genes and design of informed management
strategies. With the advent of high throughput sequencing technologies,
obtaining genomic sequences for representative populations has been easier than
ever before. This in combination with a move towards more reproducible research
has led researchers to move away from traditional stand alone programs for
population genetic analysis to modular programs such as R, which has a vibrant
community of contributers submitting packages tailored for several analyses,
including population genetics. The R package poppr was released to specifically
address issues surrounding analysis of clonal populations and has recently
implemented several tools that better facilitate the analysis of clonal
populations across different levels of hierarchies, implementing multilocus
genotype definitions and the index of association for reduced representation
genomic data, and modular bootstrapping of any genetic distance.

\end{itemize}

Most computational tools for population genetics are based on concepts
developed for sexual model organisms. Populations that reproduce
clonally or are polyploid are thus difficult to characterize using
classical population genetic tools.

The research community using the R statistical and computing language
(RCoreTeam, 2013) has developed a plethora of new resources for
population genetic analysis (Paradis, 2010; Jombart, 2008). Recently, we
introduced the R package \emph{poppr} specifically developed for
analysis of clonal populations (Kamvar et al., 2014). \emph{Poppr}
previously introduced several novel features including the ability to
conduct a hierarchical analysis across unlimited hierarchies, test for
linkage association, graph minimum spanning networks or provide
bootstrap support for Bruvo's distance in resulting trees. In its first
iteration, \emph{poppr} was appropriate for traditional markers systems,
but not ideally suited to population genomic data resulting from high
throughput sequencing methods.

\subsection{Zhian, please start producing figs and tables to frame the
gist of the paper
\ldots{}}\label{zhian-please-start-producing-figs-and-tables-to-frame-the-gist-of-the-paper}

As highlighted in previous work, clone correction is an important part
of population genetic analysis of organisms that have cryptic growth or
are known to produce asexual propagules (Kamvar et al., 2014; Milgroom,
1996; Gr√ºnwald et al., 2003). This method removes bias that would
otherwise affect metrics that rely on allele frequencies. It was
initially designed for data with only a handful of markers. With the
advent of large-scale sequencing and reduced- representation libraries,
it has become easier to sequence tens of thousands of markers from
hundreds of individuals (Elshire et al., 2011; Davey et al., 2011; Davey
and Blaxter, 2010). With this number of markers, the genetic resolution
is much greater, but the chance of genotyping error is also greatly
increased (Mastretta-Yanes et al., 2014). Taking this and somatic
mutation into account, it would be impossible to separate true clones
from independent individuals by just comparing what multilocus genotypes
are different. We introduce a a new transparent method for collapsing
unique multilocus genotypes determined by naive string comparison into
multilocus lineages utilizing any genetic distance given three different
clustering algorithms: farthest neighbor, nearest neighbor, and average
neighbor {[}citation needed{]}.

\subsection*{Index of association}\label{index-of-association}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Index of association}

The index of association (\(I_A\)) is a measure of multilocus linkage
disequilibrium that is most often used to detect clonal reproduction
within organisms that have the ability to reproduce via sexual or
asexual processes (brown1980; maynard1993; Milgroom, 1996). It was
standardized in 2001 as \(\bar{r}_d\) by (Agapow and Burt, 2001) to
address the issue of scaling with increasing number of loci. This metric
is typically applied to traditional dominant and co-dominant markers
such as AFLPs, SNPs, or microsatellite markers. With the advent of high
throughput sequencing, SNP data is now available in in a genome-wide
context and in very large matrices including thousands of SNPs. Thus,
the likelihood of finding mutations within two individuals of a given
clone increases and tools are needed for defining clone boundaries. For
this reason, we devised two approaches using the index of association
for large numbers of markers typical for population genomic studies.

  Clone correction based on genetic distance

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    reduced representation data (GBS)

  Index of Association

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Invented for small number of markers
  \item
    Methods of \(\bar{r}_d\) for large number of markers:
  \item
    sliding window (could be a fast way to detect linkage)
  \item
    random sampling of x loci (creates a distribution of \(\bar{r}_d\))
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Bootstrapping genetic distance

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Matrix algebra makes it easy to calculate genetic distance in R
    (with alleles in columns).
  \item
    Alleles in columns makes it hard to bootstrap (alleles are not
    independent units).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Population Stratification

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    Necessary for analyses of factorial sampling (Everhart and Scherm,
    2014) or hierarchical sampling (Linde et al., 2002)
  \item
    Implementation in StrataG and Hierfstat loosely defined.
