\begin{abstract}

To gain a detailed understanding of how plant microbes evolve and adapt to
hosts, pesticides, and other factors, knowledge of the population dynamics and
evolutionary history of populations is crucial. Plant pathogen populations are
often clonal or partially clonal which requires different analytical tools. With
the advent of high throughput sequencing technologies, obtaining genomic
sequences for representative populations has become easier than ever before. A
move towards open, reproducible science has provided impetus for developing
population genetic analysis tools in R. We previously contributed the R package
\textit{poppr} specifically addressing issues with analysis of clonal
populations. In this paper we provide several significant extensions to
\textit{poppr} with a focus on large, genome wide SNP data. Specifically, we
provide analyses across any level of hierarchies, a new function to define clone
boundaries we call \texttt{mlg.filter} allowing for inspection and definition of
what is a clonal lineage, the index of association for reduced representation
genomic data, and modular bootstrapping of any genetic distance.

\section*{Introduction}\label{introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

To paraphrase Dobzhansky, nothing in the field of plant-microbe
interactions makes sense except in the light of population genetics
(Dobzhansky, 1973). Genetic forces such as selection and drift act on
alleles in a population. Thus, a true understanding of how plant
pathogens evolve and adapt to crops, fungicides, or other factors, can
only emerge in the context of population level phenomena given the
demographic history of populations (McDonald and Linde, 2002; Gr端nwald
and Goss, 2011; Milgroom et al., 1989). The field of population
genetics, in the era of whole genome resequencing, provides
unprecedented power to describe the evolutionary history and population
processes that drive coevolution between pathogens and hosts. This
powerful field thus critically enables effective deployment of R genes,
design of pathogen informed plant resistance breeding programs, and
implementation of fungicide rotations that minimize emergence of
resistance.

Most computational tools for population genetics are based on concepts
developed for sexual model organisms. Populations that reproduce
clonally or are polyploid are thus difficult to characterize using
classical population genetic tools because theoretical assumptions
underlying the theory are violated. Yet, many plant pathogen populations
are at least partially clonal if not completely clonal (Milgroom, 1996;
Anderson and Kohn, 1995). Thus, development of tools for analysis of
clonal or polyploid populations is needed.

Genotyping by sequencing and whole genome resequencing provide the
unprecedented ability to identify thousands of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in populations (Elshire et al., 2011; Luikart et
al., 2003; Davey et al., 2011). With traditional marker data (e.g., SSR,
AFLP) a clone was typically defined as a unique multilocus genotype
(MLG) (Gr{端}nwald and Hoheisel, 2006; Falush et al., 2003; Goss et al.,
2009; Cooke et al., 2012; Taylor and Fisher, 2003). Availability of
large SNP data sets provides new challenges for data analysis. These
data are based on reduced representation libaries and high throughput
sequencing with moderate sequencing depth which invariably results in
substantial missing data, error in SNP calling due to sequencing error,
lack of read depth or other sources of spurious allele calls
(Mastretta-Yanes et al., 2015). It is thus not clear what a clone is in
large SNP data sets and novel tools are required for definition of clone
boundaries.

The research community using the R statistical and computing language (R
Core Team, 2015) has developed a plethora of new resources for
population genetic analysis (Paradis, 2010; Jombart, 2008). Recently, we
introduced the R package \emph{poppr} specifically developed for
analysis of clonal populations (Kamvar et al., 2014b). \emph{Poppr}
previously introduced several novel features including the ability to
conduct a hierarchical analysis across unlimited hierarchies, test for
linkage association, graph minimum spanning networks or provide
bootstrap support for Bruvo's distance in resulting trees.

In version 1.1, to facilitate handling hierarchical and mutlilocus
genotypic metadata, a new S4 data object called ``genclone'' was defined
to expand the genind object of \emph{adegenet}. The genclone object
formalized the definitions of multilocus genotypes and population
hierarchies by adding two slots called ``mlg'' and ``hierarchy'' that
carried a numeric vector and a data frame, respectively. These new slots
allow for increased efficiency and ease of use by allowing these
metadata to travel with the genetic data. The addition of the population
hierarchies has proved to be advantageous enough that they have recently
been incorporated directly into the \emph{adegenet} package (Jombart,
2008).

Here, we introduce \emph{poppr} 2.0, which provides a major update to
\emph{poppr} (Kamvar et al., 2014b) including novel tools for analysis
of clonal populations specifically addressing large SNP data.
Significant novel tools include functions for calculating clone
boundaries and collapsing individuals into user- specified clones based
on genetic distance, sliding window analyses, genotype accumulation
curves, reticulations in minimum spanning networks, and bootstrapping
for any genetic distance.

\section*{Implementations and
Examples}\label{implementations-and-examples}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Implementations and Examples}

\subsection*{Clonal identification}\label{clonal-identification}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Clonal identification}

As highlighted in previous work, clone correction is an important
component of population genetic analysis of organisms that have cryptic
growth or are known to reproduce asexually (Kamvar et al., 2014b;
Milgroom, 1996; Gr端nwald et al., 2003). This method is a partial
correction for bias that affects metrics that rely on allele frequencies
assuming panmixia. It was initially designed for data with only a
handful of markers. With the advent of large-scale sequencing and
reduced-representation libraries, it has become easier to sequence tens
of thousands of markers from hundreds of individuals (Elshire et al.,
2011; Davey et al., 2011; Davey and Blaxter, 2010). With this larger
number of markers, the genetic resolution is much greater, but the
chance of genotyping error is also greatly increased (Mastretta-Yanes et
al., 2015). Taking this fact and occasional somatic mutations into
account, it would be impossible to separate true clones from independent
individuals by just comparing what multilocus genotypes are different.
We introduce a new method for collapsing unique multilocus genotypes
determined by naive string comparison into multilocus lineages utilizing
any genetic distance given three different clustering algorithms:
farthest neighbor, nearest neighbor, and UPGMA (average neighbor)
(Sokal, 1958).

These clustering algorithms act on a distance matrix that is either
provided by the user or generated via a function that will calculate a
distance from genclone objects such as \texttt{bruvo.dist}, which in
particular applies to any level of ploidy (Bruvo et al., 2004). All
algorithms have been implemented in C and utilize the OpenMP framework
for optional parallel processing (Dagum and Menon, 1998). Default is the
conservative farthest neighbor algorithm (Fig. 1A), which will only
cluster samples together if all samples in the cluster are at a distance
less than the given threshold. By contrast, the nearest neighbor
algorithm will have a chaining effect that will cluster samples akin to
adding links on a chain where a sample can be included in a cluster if
all of the samples have at least one connection below a given threshold
(Fig. 1C). The UPGMA, or average neighbor clustering algorithm is the
one most familiar to biologists as it is often used to generate
ultra-metric trees based on genetic distance (Fig. 1B). This algorithm
will cluster by creating a representative sample per cluster and joining
clusters if these representative samples are closer than the given
threshold.

We utilize data from the microbe \emph{Phytophthora infestans} to show
how the \texttt{mlg.filter} function collapses multilocus genotypes with
Bruvo's distance assuming a genome addition model (Bruvo et al., 2004).
\emph{P. infestans} is the causal agent of potato late blight
originating from Mexico and spread to Europe in the mid 19th century
(Goss et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013; Lees et al., 2006). \emph{P.
infestans} reproduces both clonally and sexually. The clonal lineages of
\emph{P. infestans} have been formally defined into 18 separate clonal
lineages using a combination of various molecular methods including AFLP
and microsatellite markers (Lees et al., 2006). For these data, we used
\texttt{mlg.filter} to detect all of the distance thresholds at which 18
multilocus lineages would be resolved. We used these thresholds to
define multilocus lineages and create contingency tables and dendrograms
to determine how well the multilocus lineages were detected.

For the \emph{P. infestans} population, the three algorithms were able
to detect 18 multilocus lineages at different distance thresholds (Fig.
2). Contingency tables between the described multilocus genotypes and
the genotypes defined by distance show that most of the 18 lineages were
resolved, except for US-8, which is polytomic (Table 1).

We utilized simulated data constructed using the \texttt{glSim} function
in \emph{adegenet} (Jombart and Ahmed, 2011) to obtain a SNP data set
for demonstration. Two diploid data sets were created, each with 10k
SNPs (25\% structured into two groups) and 200 samples with 10 ancestral
populations of even sizes. Clones were created in one data set by
marking each sample with a unique identifier and then randomly sampling
with replacement. It is well documented that reduced-representation
sequencing can introduce several erroneous calls and missing data
(Mastretta-Yanes et al., 2015). To reflect this, we mutated SNPs at a
rate of 10\% and inserted an average of 10\% missing data for each
sample after clones were created, ensuring that no two sequences were
alike. The number of mutations and missing data per sample were
determined by sampling from a Poisson distribution with
\(\lambda = 1000\). After pooling, 20\% of the data set was randomly
sampled for analysis. Genetic distance was obtained with the function
\texttt{bitwise.dist}, which calculates the fraction of different sites
between samples, counting missing data as equivalent in comparison.

All three filtering algorithms were run with a threshold of 1, returning
a numeric vector of length \(n - 1\) where each element represented a
threshold at which two samples/clusters would join. Since each data set
would have varying distances between samples, the clonal boundary
threshold was defined as the midpoint of the largest gap between two
thresholds that collapsed less than 50\% of the data.

Out of the 100 simulations run, we found that across all methods,
detection of duplicated samples had \(\sim\) 98\% true positive fraction
and \(\sim\) 0.8\% false positive fraction indicating that this method
is robust to simulated populations.

\subsection*{Minimum Spanning Networks with
Reticulation}\label{minimum-spanning-networks-with-reticulation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Minimum Spanning Networks with
Reticulation}

In its original iteration, \emph{poppr} introduced minimum spanning
networks that were based on the \emph{igraph} function
\texttt{minimum.spanning.tree} (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006). This algorithm
produces a minimum spanning tree with no reticulations where nodes
represent individual MLGs. In other minimum spanning network programs,
reticulation is obtained by calculating the minimum spanning tree
several times and returning the set of all edges included in the trees.
Due to the way \emph{igraph} has implemented Prim's algorithm, it is not
possible to utilize this strategy, thus we implemented an internal C
function to walk the space of minimum spanning trees based on genetic
distance to connect groups of nodes with edges of equal weight.

To demonstrate the utility of minimum spanning networks with
reticulation, we used two clonal data sets: the H3N2 flu virus data from
the \emph{adegenet} package using years of each epidemic as the
population factor, and \emph{Phytophthora ramorum} data from Nurseries
and Oregon forests (Jombart et al., 2010; Kamvar et al., 2014a). Minimum
spanning networks were created with and without reticulation using the
\emph{poppr} functions \texttt{diss.dist} and \texttt{bruvo.msn} for the
H3N2 and \emph{P. ramorum} data, respectively (Kamvar et al., 2014b;
Bruvo et al., 2004). To detect mlg clusters, the infoMAP community
detection algorithm was applied with 10,000 trials as implemented in the
R package \emph{igraph} version 0.7.1 utilizing genetic distance as edge
weights and number of samples in each MLG as vertex weights (Csardi and
Nepusz, 2006; Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008).

To evaluate the results, we compared the number, size, and entropy
(\(H\)) of the resulting communities as we expect a highly clonal
organism with low genetic diversity to result in a few, large
communities. We also created contingency tables of the community
assignments with the defined populations and used those to calculate
entropy using Shannon's index with the function \texttt{diversity} from
the R package \emph{vegan} version 2.2-1 (Oksanen et al., 2015; Shannon,
2001). A low entropy indicates presence of a few large communities
whereas high entropy indicates presence of many small communities.

The infoMAP algorithm revealed 63 communities with a maximum community
size of 77 and \(H = 3.56\) for the reticulate network of the H3N2 data
and 117 communities with a maximum community size of 26 and \(H = 4.65\)
for the minimum spanning tree. The entropy across years was greatly
decreased for all populations with the reticulate network compared to
the minimum spanning tree (Fig. 3).

Graph walking of the reticulated minimum spanning network of \emph{P.
ramorum} by the infoMAP algorithm revealed 16 communities with a maximum
community size of 13 and \(H = 2.60\). The un-reticulated minimum
spanning tree revealed 20 communities with a maximum community size of 7
and \(H = 2.96\). In the ability to predict Hunter Creek as belonging to
a single community, the reticulated network was successful whereas the
minimum spanning tree separated one genotype from that community. The
entropy for the reticulated network was lower for all populations except
for the coast population (supplementary information).

\subsection*{Bootstrapping}\label{bootstrapping}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Bootstrapping}

Assessing population differentiation through methods such as \(G_{st}\),
AMOVA, and Mantel tests relies on comparing samples within and across
populations (Nei, 1973; Excoffier et al., 1992; Mantel, 1967).
Confidence in distance metrics is related to the confidence in the
markers to accurately represent the diversity of the data. Especially
true with microsatellite markers, a single hyper-diverse locus can make
a population appear to have more diversity based on genetic distance.
Using a bootstrapping procedure of randomly sampling loci with
replacement when calculating a distance matrix provides support for
clades in hierarchical clustering. Because genetic data in a genind
object is represented as a matrix with samples in rows and alleles in
columns, bootstrapping is a non-trivial task as all alleles at a single
locus need to be sampled together. To remedy this, we have created an
internal S4 class called ``bootgen'', which extends the internal ``gen''
class from \emph{adegenet}. This class can be created from any genind,
genclone, or genpop object, and allows loci to be sampled with
replacement. To further facilitate bootstrapping, a function called
\texttt{aboot}, which stands for ``any boot'', is introduced that will
bootstrap any genclone, genind, or genpop object with any genetic
distance that can be calculated from it.

To demonstrate calculating a dendrogram with bootstrap support, we used
the \emph{poppr} function \texttt{aboot} on population allelic
frequencies derived from the data set \texttt{microbov} in the
\emph{adegenet} package with 1000 bootstrap replicates (Jombart, 2008;
Lalo{谷} et al., 2007). The resulting dendrogram shows bootstrap support
values \(>50\%\) (Fig. 4).

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
library("poppr")
data("microbov", package = "adegenet") 
strata(microbov) <- data.frame(other(microbov)) 
setPop(microbov) <- ~coun/spe/breed 
bov_pop <- genind2genpop(microbov, quiet = TRUE) 

set.seed(20150428)
pop_tree <- aboot(bov_pop, sample = 1000, cutoff = 50, quiet = TRUE)
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\subsection*{Genotype Accumulation
Curve}\label{genotype-accumulation-curve}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Genotype Accumulation Curve}

Analysis of population genetics of clonal organisms often borrows from
ecological methods such as analysis of diversity within populations
(Milgroom, 1996; Arnaud-Hanod et al., 2007; Gr端nwald et al., 2003). When
choosing markers for analysis, it is important to make sure that the
observed diversity in your sample will not appreciably increase if an
additional marker is added (Arnaud-Hanod et al., 2007). This concept is
analogous to a species accumulation curve, obtained by rarefaction. The
genotype accumulation curve in \emph{poppr} is implemented in the
function \texttt{genotype\_curve}. The curve is constructed by randomly
sampling \(x\) loci and counting the number of observed MLGs. This
repeated \(r\) times for 1 locus up to \(n-1\) loci, creating \(n-1\)
distributions of observed MLGs.

The following code example demonstrates the genotype accumulation curve
for data from Everhart and Scherm (2015) showing that these data reach a
small plateau and have a greatly decreased variance with 12 markers,
indicating that there are enough markers such that adding more markers
to the analysis will not create very many new genotypes (Fig. 5).

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
library("poppr")
library("ggplot2")
data("monpop", package = "poppr")

set.seed(20150428)
genotype_curve(monpop, sample = 1000, quiet = TRUE)
p <- last_plot() + theme_bw()   # get the last plot
p + geom_smooth(aes(group = 1)) # plot with a trendline
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\subsection*{Index of association}\label{index-of-association}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Index of association}

The index of association (\(I_A\)) is a measure of multilocus linkage
disequilibrium that is most often used to detect clonal reproduction
within organisms that have the ability to reproduce via sexual or
asexual processes (Brown et al., 1980; Smith et al., 1993; Milgroom,
1996). It was standardized in 2001 as \(\bar{r}_d\) by Agapow and Burt
(2001) to address the issue of scaling with increasing number of loci.
This metric is typically applied to traditional dominant and co-dominant
markers such as AFLPs, SNPs, or microsatellite markers. With the advent
of high throughput sequencing, SNP data is now available in a
genome-wide context and in very large matrices including thousands of
SNPs. Thus, the likelihood of finding mutations within two individuals
of a given clone increases and tools are needed for defining clone
boundaries. For this reason, we devised two approaches using the index
of association for large numbers of markers typical for population
genomic studies. Both functions utilize \emph{adegenet}'s ``genlight''
object class, which efficiently stores 8 binary alleles in a single byte
(Jombart and Ahmed, 2011). As calculation of the \(\bar{r}_d\) requires
distance matrices of absolute number of differences, we utilize a
function that calculates these distances directly from the compressed
data called \texttt{bitwise.dist}.

The first approach is a sliding window approach implemented in the
function \texttt{win.ia}. It utilizes the position of markers in the
genome to calculate \(\bar{r}_d\) among any number of SNPs found within
a user-specified windowed region. It is important that this calculation
utilize \(\bar{r}_d\) as the number of loci will be different within
each window (Agapow and Burt, 2001). This approach would be suited for a
quick calculation of linkage disequilibrium across the genome that can
detect potential hotspots of LD that could be investigated further with
more computationally intensive methods assuming that the number of
samples \textless{}\textless{} the number of loci.

As it would necessarily focus on loci within a short section of the
genome that may or may not be recombining, a sliding window approach
would not be good for utilizing \(\bar{r}_d\) as a test for clonal
reproduction. A remedy for this is implemented in the function
\texttt{samp.ia}, which will randomly sample \(m\) loci, calculate
\(\bar{r}_d\), and repeat \(r\) times, thus creating a distribution of
expected values of \(\bar{r}_d\).

To demonstrate the sliding window and random sampling of \(\bar{r}_d\)
with respect to clonal populations, we simulated two populations
containing 1,100 neutral SNPs for 100 diploid individuals under the same
initial seed. One population had individuals randomly sampled with
replacement, representing the clonal population. After sampling, both
populations had 5\% random error and 1\% missing data independently
propagated across all samples. On average, we obtained a higher value of
\(\bar{r}_d\) for the clonal population compared to the sexual
population for both methods (Fig. 6).

\subsection*{Change in definition of population Strata and
Hierarchies}\label{change-in-definition-of-population-strata-and-hierarchies}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Change in definition of population
Strata and Hierarchies}

Assessments of population structure through methods such as hierarchical
\(F_{st}\) (Goudet, 2005) and AMOVA (Michalakis and Excoffier, 1996)
require hierarchical sampling of populations across space or time (Linde
et al., 2002; Everhart and Scherm, 2015; Gr{端}nwald and Hoheisel, 2006).
With clonal organisms, basic practice has been to clone-censor data to
avoid downward bias in diversity due to duplicated genotypes that may or
may not represent different samples (Milgroom, 1996). This correction
should be performed with respect to a population hierarchy to accurately
reflect the biology of the organism. Traditional data structures for
population genetic data in most analysis tools allow for only one level
of hierarchical definition. The investigator thus had to provide the
data set for analysis at each hierarchical level. In \emph{poppr}
version 1.1, the hierarchy slot was introduced to allow unlimited
population hierarchies or stratifications to travel with the data
(Kamvar et al., 2014b). In R, it is stored as a data frame where each
column represents a separate hierarchical level. This is then used to
set the population factor of the data by supplying a hierarchical
formula containing one or more column names of the data frame in the
hierarchy slot. This functionality, has now been migrated to the
\emph{adegenet} package, version 2.0 to allow hierarchical analysis in
\emph{adegenet}, \emph{poppr}, and other dependent packages. The prior
\emph{poppr} \texttt{hierarchy} slot and methods have now been renamed
\texttt{strata} in \emph{adegenet}. This migration provides end users
with a broader ability to analyze data hierarchically in R across
packages.

\section*{Availability}\label{availability}

As of this writing, the \emph{poppr} R package version 2.0 containing
all of the features described here is located at
\url{https://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr/tree/2.0-rc}. It is necessary
to install \emph{adegenet} 2.0 before installing \emph{poppr}. It can be
found at \url{https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet}. Both of these
can be installed via the R package \emph{devtools} (Wickham and Chang,
2015):

\begin{CodeChunk}

install_github("grunwaldlab/poppr@2.0-rc")
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Several population genetics packages in R are currently going through a
major upgrade and have not yet been updated in CRAN. We will push
\emph{poppr} 2.0 to CRAN, once all other reverse dependent packages have
been updated.

\section*{Discussion}\label{discussion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Discussion}

Genomic data has become more readily accessible due to advances in
low-cost sequencing technology. Many tools have been developed or
adapted to these data, but most of them were designed with sexual
populations in mind. Particularly important is the implementation of
\(\bar{r}_d\) for genomic data (Agapow and Burt, 2001). Random sampling
of loci across the genome can give an expected distribution of
\(\bar{r}_d\), which is expected to have a mean of zero for panmictic
populations. Additionally, due to the fact that the it acts on multiple
loci, is not affected by the number of loci sampled, and has the ability
to detect population structure, \(\bar{r}_d\) is well suited to sliding
window analyses and has the potential to be applied to non-clonal
populations.

Clustering multilocus genotypes into multilocus lineages based on
genetic distances is a non-trivial task. Moreover, this has not
previously been implemented for genomic data for clonal populations.
Perhaps highlighting the fact that many of the features presented in
this paper are not exclusive to genomic data is the fact that this
method of clonal assignment has been available in the programs
\textsc{GenClone} and \textsc{Genodive} (Arnaud-Hanod et al., 2007;
Meirmans and Van Tienderen, 2004). Our method with \texttt{mlg.filter}
builds upon this idea and allows the user to choose between three
different approaches for clustering MLGs. As shown in Fig. 2, it is
clear that the choice of clustering algorithm has an impact on the data,
where a genetic distance cutoff of 0.1 would be the difference between
14 MLLs and 17 MLLs for nearest neighbor and UPGMA clustering,
respectively (Fig. 2). The option to choose the clustering algorithm
gives the user the ability to choose what is biologically relevant to
their populations.

Multilocus genotypes that have been clustered can then be visualized in
minimum spanning networks. Reticulate minimum spanning networks are very
important for clonal organisms where a minimum spanning tree would
become a chain, implying that the clones were derived in a progressive
and linear fashion. This presents but one potential scenario for clonal
organisms, but does not account for any other biologically relevant
process. Reticulations in the minimum spanning networks allow for a
representation of uncertainty that goes along with clonal organisms. The
current implementation in \emph{poppr} has been successfully used in
analyses such as reconstruction of the \emph{P. ramorum} epidemic in
Curry County, OR (Kamvar et al., 2014a, 2015). Reticulated networks also
allow for the application of graph community detection algorithms such
as the infoMAP algorithm (Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008). As shown in the
\emph{P. ramorum} and H3N2 data, while it is possible to utilize these
graph walking algorithms on non-reticulate minimum spanning trees, the
results derived from these are limited to explain populations derived
from serial cloning events.

Implementing these methods in R and hosting the code free and open on
GitHub has given us the ability to tailor our tools for the needs of the
researchers who use them.

Diagrammatic representation of the three clustering algorithms
implemented in \texttt{mlg.filter}. (\textbf{A-C}) represent different
clustering algorithms on the same imaginary network with a threshold of
0.45. Edge weights are represented in arbitrary units noted by the line
thickness and numerical values next to the lines. All outer angles are
90 degrees, so the un-labled edge weights can be obtained with simply
geometry. Colored circles represent clusters of genotypes. (\textbf{A})
Farthest neighbor clustering does not cluster nodes B and C because
nodes A and C are more than a distance of 0.45 apart. (\textbf{B}) UPGMA
(average neighbor) clustering clusters nodes A, B, and C together
because the average distance between them and C is \textless{} 0.45.
(\textbf{C}) Nearest neighbor clustering clusters all nodes together
because the minimum distance between them is always \textless{} 0.45.
