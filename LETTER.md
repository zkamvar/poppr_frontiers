# Message from Dan McLean

Dear Prof Grunwald, 

We are compiling a research topic on Plant Microbe Interactions and Computational Biology. The aim of this topic is to discuss all that is greatest and most impactful in the application of bioinformatics and computer science to the field of Plant Microbe Interactions. In this research topic we will bring together reports and reviews on the most recent and promising techniques for making the most of the new data sets to both bring new insights in basic research in the field of plant-microbe interactions.
We have read with great interest your work on population genomics in filamentous plant pathogens, in particular we are inspired by your recent computational work and tools such as Poppr.  We think this is a fantastic example of large scale comparative analysis and software development and believe that our topic would be greatly enriched by a discussion of the methods and applications this work touches upon.


In collaboration with Frontiers in Plant Science, section Plant Genetics and Genomics, we are organizing a Research Topic titled "Plant Microbe Interactions and Computational Biology‚Äù, hosted by Dan MacLean, Leighton Pritchard, Ann Stapleton. As host editor, I would like to encourage you to contribute to this topic.

Frontiers, a Swiss open-access publisher, recently partnered with Nature Publishing Group to expand its researcher-driven Open Science platform. Frontiers articles are rigorously peer-reviewed, can be disseminated freely and are widely read by your colleagues and by the broader scientific and medical research communities.

The idea behind a research topic is to create an organized, comprehensive collection of several contributions, as well as a forum for discussion and debate. Contributions can be articles describing original research, methods, hypothesis & theory, opinions, etc.

We have created a homepage on the Frontiers website (Frontiers in Plant Science, section Plant Genetics and Genomics) where all articles will appear after peer-review and where participants in the topic will be able to hold relevant discussions:
http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Genetics_and_Genomics/researchtopics/Plant_Microbe_Interactions_and/3314.

Frontiers will also compile an e-book, as soon as all contributing articles are published, that can be used in classes, be sent to foundations that fund your research, to journalists and press agencies, or to any number of other organizations.

Among others, we have contacted the following authors:

- Ryan Austin
- Andy Mead
- Brian Haas
- Dan MacLean
- Francis Michel Martin
- Nik Grunwald
- Jason E Stajich
- Fumiaki Katagiri
- Kentaro Yoshida
- Kim Hammond-Kosack
- Klaas Vandepoele
- Leighton Pritchard
- Michael Seidl
- Magdalen Lindeberg
- Paul Kersey 


As such, a manuscript accepted for publication incurs a publishing fee, which varies depending on the article type. Research Topic manuscripts receive a significant discount on publishing fees. Please take a look at this fee table: http://www.frontiersin.org/about/PublishingFees.

Once published, your articles will remain free to access for all readers, and will be indexed in PubMed and other academic archives. As an author in Frontiers, you retain the copyright to your own papers and figures.

I would be delighted if you considered participating in this Research Topic.

Should you choose to participate, please confirm by sending me a quick email and then your abstract no later than Nov 07, 2014 using the following link: http://www.frontiersin.org/Plant_Genetics_and_Genomics/researchtopics/Plant_Microbe_Interactions_and/3314 


### Please note that the deadline for manuscript submission is on: May 08, 2015
